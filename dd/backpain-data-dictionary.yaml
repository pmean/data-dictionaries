source:
  The file backpain.txt was originally from the OzDASL
  (Australian Data and Story Library) website. The 
  version stored here is greatly simplified from the 
  original version. If you are curious, you can find a
  full data dictionary and a link to the full dataset at

description:
  The study recruited runners with lower back pain and 
  found matching subjects among runners without lower 
  back pain and among a sedentary group of adults. 
  Matches were done on age, height, and weight. The 
  question that I want to address with this data does 
  not involve one of the many outcome measures. Rather, 
  I want to see how closely the subjects were matched 
  to one another.
